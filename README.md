This is a mini project i am working on that utilizes the Pokemon API. From there, I comverted it into JSON data so I can extract their name, type, max/min stats. Based on these results, this little calculator will demonstrate how to counter the inputted pokemon by targetting its weaknesses.
This calculator will indicate the lowest stat and then produce the contrary stat that can defeat it.
